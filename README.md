# Owlauth Documentation

The owlauth-spec repository holds the documentation, including specification, for a new authentication protocol called Owlauth.

## Status

Owlauth is still in development.  An initial server implementation and client library is working, but not yet published.

The specification is available as an initial write-up here: https://github.com/owlfish/owlauth-spec/blob/master/Specification.md

## Test Application

A test application is now running at https://owlfish.com/larder .  The application uses Owlauth for login and implements a fallback to email based authentication for domains that do not have an Owlauth server running.  Feel free to give it a try!
