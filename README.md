# Owlauth Documentation

The owlauth-spec repository holds the documentation, including specification, for a new authentication protocol called Owlauth.

## Status

Owlauth is still in development.  An initial server implementation and client library is working, but not yet published.

The specification is available as an initial write-up here: https://github.com/cms103/owlauth-spec/blob/master/Specification.md
